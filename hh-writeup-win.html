It ran from 8th-26th July, with a set of challenges releasing each week. At the end, all participants were encouraged to send in their writeups for the challenges, and the best writeups were announced today on their <a href="https://hackyholidays.io">website</a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/hh-writeup-winners.png" alt="" /></p><p>My writeup was selected as one of 10 best writeups from this CTF! The challenge, Technical Debt was my favorite challenge from this year’s competition, and typing the writeup was an equally fun process! Adding to that, the fact that my very first set of published writeups were from Hacky Holidays 2021 made this all the more special. ✨</p><p>Read here: <a href="https://github.com/piyagehi/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/2022-Unlock-The-City/technical-debt.md">https://github.com/piyagehi/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/2022-Unlock-The-City/technical-debt.md</a></p></main><a href="/tagged/hacky-holidays">#hacky-holidays</a> <a href="/tagged/deloitte">#deloitte</a> <a href="/tagged/ctf">#ctf</a> <a href="/tagged/writeups">#writeups</a><footer> <a href="/blog">← Back to all posts</a><div class="bottom-footer"> © 2022 <a href="/">Piya Gehi</a> Theme <a href="https://knhash.in/jekyllBear" title="the art">jekyllBear</a> built and maintained by <a href="https://knhash.in" title="the artist">knhash</a></footer>
